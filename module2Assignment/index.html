                        Chicken is a versatile, nutritious, and low-calorie protein that can be prepared in many ways. Here are some chicken dishes:
                        Fried chicken: Chicken pieces coated with seasoned batter or flour and then pan-fried, deep fried, air fried, or pressure fried.
                        The breading gives the chicken a crispy crust while keeping the meat juicy.
                        Butter chicken: An Indian dish made with mildly spiced tomato sauce.
                        Chicken tikka masala: An Indian main dish.
                        Karaage: A Japanese dish.
                        Buldak: A Korean dish made from heavily spiced chicken.
                        Marinated barbecue chicken: A chicken dish.
                        Coq au vin: A French dish of chicken braised with wine, mushrooms, lardons, and optionally garlic.

                        There are many kinds of crave worthy foods. From foods that are sweet and salty to savory, there is one crave-able item that sure gets consumers talking.
                        National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a contractor to the Beef Checkoff, recently conducted research on consumer preferences for burgers when dining out.
                        Consumers' own words highlight just how enticing burgers are for them.
                        Many consumers enjoy a beef burger whenever they get a chance, and many of us have our go-to places for one.
                        However, the results show that quick-service establishments aren't the only places consumers go for a burger.
                        In fact, many also choose casual or even fine-dining establishments to enjoy a burger.

                    <p>
                        Sushi can include a variety of types of fish, including sashimi, nigiri, and maki.
                        Sashimi is thinly sliced fish or meat, often served raw, without rice.
                        Nigiri is a slice of fish placed over a small bit of rice. Maki are bite-sized rolls with seaweed on the outside and rice (and other ingredients) on the inside.
